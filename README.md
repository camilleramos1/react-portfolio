## Description
I created this personal portfolio to showcase some of my skills and previous projects to employers. Using React and Tailwind, I built the portfolio containing the following sections: Home, About Me, Portfolio, Resume, and Contact. In the portfolio section, there are 6 of my previous projects displayed with links to both the live site or demo, and the code via GitHub.

## Technologies
Some of the technologies I used to build this application are: 
* Tailwind
* React Scroll
* Getform.io
* React Icons
* React Scrollspy

## Usage
To use the site, navigate to the deployed application link: Here, the application loads to the home screen on default. Using the links in the nav bar, you are able to quickly navigate to the desired section. You may also scroll down through the site to view the different elements. On the left of the screen, there are social links you may hover through and select from that will navigate you to my social profiles and also download my resume. At the bottom of the page, you are able to submit a contact form if you would like to reach out to me.

## Screenshot

## Challenges
Some of the challenges I faced while making this portfolio revolved around tailwind. This was one of my first experiences using primarily tailwind to style. I feel as though I learned a lot through out the journey of building this portfolio, and how to best utilize tailwind.
